A recreation of the BBC News Technology page as part of an assignment on the Udemy Complete Web Developer 2.0 course

This involved taking a snapshot of the top screen of the Technology news page and attempting to re-create it using HTML and CSS so that it would be a close enough match to pass a cursory examination.

My re-creation files:

bbc-news-tech.html
bbc-news-tech.css

Downloaded files from the original website:

Technology - BBC News.html

I know that some of the spacing is a little bit out, but I think it would most likely fool someone if they just glanced at it in passing.
